## ECSE 343 Numerical Methods Final Project

This repository will include all of the necessary jupyter notebooks and scripts to compile the `main.py` file displaying all of our experiments for the optimization problem.

### TODO:

- [x] Himmelblau, Rosebrock 2D & ND Function Gradients, Hessians
- [x] Newton's three methods 
- [x] Gradient descent method
- [x] Initial experiments
- [ ] Convergence experiments (Time, preformance)
- [ ] Convergence conditions
- [ ] Hyperparameter variation
